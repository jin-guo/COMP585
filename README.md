- The lectures consist of many in-class activities to motivate discussion and collaborative learning. **In-person participation is required**.
- Occasionally, if there are unforeseen reasons that prevent you from joining the lectures in person, we will try to accommodate. Please contact us prior to the lecture.



## Description
This course is going to explore how to design and build an intelligent system from a software engineering perspective, from requirement gathering and analysis to deployment and maintenance. We will also touch AI ethics and its implications to design.

## Prerequisite
COMP 303, COMP 424/COMP 551 (or equivalent background)

## Reference Material
We will not concentrate on any particular resources. Instead, the readings will include content from book chapters, research papers, blog posts, talks, etc. The pointers to those content will be added to the schedule later.

- **Books**: 
  * [Thinking in Systems: A Primer](https://www.amazon.ca/Thinking-Systems-Primer-Donella-Meadows/dp/1603580557) (Chapter scans will be shared through OneDrive links)
  * [Human Compatible: AI and the Problem of Control](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/hc.html) (Chapter scans will be shared through OneDrive links)
  * [Design Justice](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/design-justice) (open access) 
  * [Building Intelligent Systems <em>A Guide to Machine Learning Engineering</em>](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/building-intelligent-systems/9781484234327/) (access through McGill Library)
