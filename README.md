## Policies

### Attendence
The lectures consist of in-class activities to motivate discussion and collaborative learning. **In-person participation is required and those activites are graded**. Occasionally, if there are unforeseen reasons that prevent you from joining the lectures in person, we will try to accommodate. Please contact us prior to the lecture.

### Communication
 
The University is committed to maintaining teaching and learning spaces that are respectful and inclusive for all. To this end, offensive, violent, or harmful language arising in course contexts may be cause for disciplinary action under the Article 10 of the Code of Student Conduct and Disciplinary Procedures and Section 2.7 of the Policy on Harassment, Sexual Harassment, and Discrimination Prohibited by Law.

### Post-Coronavirus-Pandemic Public Health issues
 
The Quebec government ( https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus ) provides the following guidelines for educational institutions (as of August 2023). Wearing masks is not required, however, if you are experiencing cough, sore throat, or nasal congestion it is recommended that you wear a mask and, as much as possible, keep your distance from others and advise them you may be contagious. In the case of a fever, remain at home.  

## Description
This course is going to explore how to design and build an intelligent system from a software engineering perspective, from requirement gathering and analysis to deployment and maintenance. We will also touch AI ethics and its implications to design.

## Prerequisite
COMP 303, COMP 424/COMP 551 (or equivalent background)

## Reference Material
We will not concentrate on any particular resources. Instead, the readings will include content from book chapters, research papers, blog posts, talks, etc. The pointers to those content will be added to the schedule prior to the lectures.

## Assessment and Evaluation (Tentative)

|  Assessment Method | Weight |
| :---: | :---: |
|  Activities | 25% |
|  Assignment |  35% |
|  Project | 40% |

- Any form of plagiarism, cheating is strictly banned during midterm or final exam. Integrity is crucial to this course and your future career. Any violation against academic integrity will be taken very seriously. For more information, please refer [here](https://www.mcgill.ca/students/srr/academicrights/integrity).
- Related to the use of generative AI software in your project and assignment reports, we follow the [ACM Policy on Authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/frequently-asked-questions). In particular,

>  - If you are using generative AI software tools such as ChatGPT, Jasper, AI-Writer, Lex, or other similar tools to generate new content such as text, images, tables, code, etc. you must disclose their use in either the acknowledgements section of the Work or elsewhere in the Work prominently. The level of disclosure should be commensurate with the proportion of new text or content generated by these tools.

>  - If entire sections of a Work, including tables, graphs, images, and other content were generated by one of these tools, you should disclose which sections and which tools and tool versions you used to generate those sections by preparing an Appendix or a Supplementary Material document that describes the use, including but not limited to the specific tools and versions, the text of the prompts provided as input, and any post-generation editing (such as rephrasing the generated text). Authors should also note that the amount or type of generated text allowable may vary depending on the type of the section or paper affected. For example, using such tools to generate portions of a Related Work section is fundamentally different than generating novel results or interpretations.

>  - If the amount of text being generated is small (limited to phrases or sentences), then it would be sufficient to add a footnote to the relevant section of the submission utilizing the system(s) and include a general disclaimer in the Acknowledgements section.

>  - If you are using generative AI software tools to edit and improve the quality of your existing text in much the same way you would use a typing assistant like Grammarly to improve spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, engagement or to use a basic word processing system to correct spelling or grammar, it is not necessary to disclose such usage of these tools in your Work.
